# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients by analyzing medical data using machine learning techniques. By leveraging patient features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, the model can help identify individuals at risk, aiding early diagnosis and prevention.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of clinical attributes collected from patients, including:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia
- Target variable indicating presence or absence of heart disease

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, boxplots)
- Feature selection and scaling
- Implementation of various classification algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Naive Bayes
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## Results
The Naive Bayes classifier performed best with an accuracy of approximately 85%, showing good balance between precision and recall. Other models such as SVM and Random Forest also showed promising results.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
